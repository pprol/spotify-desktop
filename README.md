# excalidraw-desktop
Unofficial desktop client for Excalidraw on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is just an electron wrapper for the website, I made this because I don't want to use it in a tab.

> **Note:** This loads the live [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com) website — an internet connection is needed for the first launch. Subsequent launches may work offline thanks to browser caching.

## Installation
Head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/pgkt04/excalidraw-desktop/releases/) page and download the appropriate installer for your operating system:

| Platform | Format |
|----------|--------|
| macOS | `.dmg` (Apple Silicon) |
| Windows | Setup `.exe` or Portable `.exe` |
| Linux | `.AppImage` or `.deb` |

### macOS
If you get the error "Is Damaged and Can't Be Opened. You Should Move It To The Bin", run:
```bash
xattr -c /Applications/Excalidraw.app
```
This is because I don't have a developer certificate and it's not notarized.

### Linux (AppImage)
After downloading, make the AppImage executable:
```bash
chmod +x Excalidraw-*.AppImage
./Excalidraw-*.AppImage
```

## File Association
The app registers itself as a handler for `.excalidraw` files. You can double-click any `.excalidraw` file to open it directly in the app. On Windows (NSIS installer), you'll be prompted during installation; on macOS and Linux, it's automatic.
